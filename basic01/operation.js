 console.log("1"+"2"+3);   //here the Result is 123,  cause "1" and "2" are strings, and the third operand (3) is a number.When at least one operand is a string, the + operator performs concatenation instead of addition. So, "1" + "2" results in the string "12", and then "12" + 3 results in "123" due to the string concatenation. Therefore, the result is "123".

 console.log(1+2+3);       //here the Result is 6 ,  these all are Numbers so it performs addititon

 console.log(1+2+"3");     //here the Result is 33, here the string value ("3") so the firs operation will be done after that at will beacome string (1+2), then the result will be 33

 console.log(1+"2"+3);     //here the Result is 123,  here the numb is add withh string then it will be 12 and it add with numb again . then the result will be 123

 console.log("1"+2+3);     //here the Result is 123,  here the string is in the starting part so the rest operants (2&3) will also be consider as string .
